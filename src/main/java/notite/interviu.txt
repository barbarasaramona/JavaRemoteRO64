1) final VS finally VS finalized
- final Keyword in Java

Final is a keyword used in Java to restrict the modification of a variable, method, or class.
When we declare a variable as final, its value cannot be changed. Similarly, when a method is declared as final,
it cannot be overridden by any subclass.
In Java, it is also possible to declare a class as final by using the final keyword to restrict the inheritance of the class.
Final classes cannot be extended or inherited. If we try to inherit a final class, then the compiler throws an error during compilation.

- finally keyword
The finally keyword is used in Java try-catch blocks to specify a block of code that will be executed regardless
of whether an exception is thrown or not. Since the finally block is guaranteed to be executed,
even if an exception is thrown, so finally block is often used in the cleanup operations,
such as closing open files and releasing the resources.

- finalize Keyword in Java
The finalize method is a special method that is called by the garbage collector when an object is about to be destroyed.
The finalize() method can be used to perform any necessary cleanup operations before the object is destroyed.
