1) Create a shop imitating application .
Create Basket class that will allow for adding ,removing and retrieving all items in the basket.
Each item is an instance of Product interface that defines two methods , one to get price of an item and one to check for
availability based on a provided date.
Create GenericProduct class that implements Product interface and will have supplier
supplying price and function checking availability based on a provided date for a particular product.
Make sure that Basket does not expose it’s internal list storing products ( meaning it will
not return a reference to it’s internal list but rather a copy ), all operations on that list
should be done through Basket methods.

2) Add some products to the Basket from exercise 1. Verify if everything works as expected.

3) Improve Basket from exercise 1 so that it also tracks quantity of a particular product
and allows for increment or decrement by a specified amount.

4) Create OrderService class that accepts instance of the Basket class from exercise 3 and
returns total price for all the items in the Basket that are available . Remember about
quantity you will have to improve Basket class again . Use streams.
